# translatedIni-Italian-Language-
A simple translation to the Italian language for ilusion

## Accuracy
For now, the translation has been done entirely by me (as I am a native Italian language) but I do not guarantee the translation is 100% accurate because I had to use a python script to translate several words together. In conclusion, some words could be translated literally.

## Getting Started
### Installation
1. Clone the repo or download `italian.ini` file from <a href="https://github.com/Daivy03/translatedIni-Italian-Language-/releases">releases</a>
 ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Daivy03/translatedIni-Italian-Language-.git
   ```
2. Move `italian.ini` file to <b>C:\Ilusion\Translations</b>
3. Open Menu and go to `Menu Settings` >`Language` > and select <b>Italian</b>


## Contributing
If you would like to help me, don't hesitate to request a pull, I need help to improve accuracy and to finish the translation (since it is a very long list)
